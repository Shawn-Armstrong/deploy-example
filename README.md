### Requirements
- Docker Compose 2.X
- DigitalOcean subscription

## Details

### Background
This mono repository contains a simplistic multi-container web application orchestrated via Docker Compose. This web application has no scaling or memory persistence requirements. The underlying logic for each container is a hello world application nested within its own directory; the stack includes:

1. Nginx (Proxy)
2. Vue.js (Frontend)
3. Rust (Backend)

For local development, Iâ€™ve configured volumes such that source code on the host machine syncs to the container's file system to streamline setup and keep development OS / dependency version agnostic. 

### Deployment Strategy

This project leverages Docker Compose's [multiple file merge feature](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/extends/#multiple-compose-files) to manage environment-specific configuration:

- `compose.yaml`: Defines shared infrastructure such as networks, volumes, and base service definitions.
- `compose.dev.yaml` and `compose.prod.yaml`: Extend and override the base file to apply development or production-specific settings.

### Running Locally
With Docker Compose installed, execute the following command:
<br>
```console
docker compose --env-file .env.dev -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up
```

| URL Path               | Container                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| https://localhost/api/ | Nginx route to backend container  |
| https://localhost/     | Nginx route to frontend container |

### DigitalOcean Deployment

Deployment to a DigitalOcean Droplet is automated using GitHub Actions:

1. The following values were added to the repository's secrets:
    - `BACKEND_IMAGE`
    - `BACKEND_PORT`
    - `DROPLET_IP`
    - `DROPLET_SSH_KEY`
    - `DROPLET_USER`
    - `ENVIRONMENT`
    - `FRONTEND_IMAGE`
2. The workflow builds Docker images for both frontend and backend then pushes to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
3. The workflow SSHs into the target Droplet using a private key stored in repository secrets.
4. On the Droplet:
   - Workflow logs in to GHCR.
   - The latest images are pulled.
   - The containers are started using `docker compose` with the production configuration.

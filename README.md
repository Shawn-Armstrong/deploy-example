# Explore Deploy Strategy

### Running
With Docker Compose installed, execute the following command:
  
```Console
docker compose --env-file .env.development up
```
  
| URL Path             | Container          |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| https://localhost/api | Nginx route to backend container  |
| https://localhost/    | Nginx route to frontend container |

### Details
This mono repository contains a simplistic multi-container web application orchestrated via Docker Compose. This web application has no scaling or memory persistence requirements. The underlying logic for each container is a hello world application nested within its own directory; the stack includes:

1. Nginx (Proxy)
2. Vue.js (Frontend)
3. Rust (Backend)

For local development, Iâ€™ve configured volumes such that source code on the host machine syncs to the container's file system to streamline setup and keep development OS / dependency version agnostic. 

### Goal 
Adapt a deployment strategy to deploy the app on a Digital Ocean droplet through a CI/CD while preserving the local development aspects.
